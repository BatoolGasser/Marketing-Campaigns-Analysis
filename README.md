# Marketing Campaigns Analysis

This project analyzes seasonal marketing campaigns (Fall, Summer, and Spring) across Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest in three UK cities (Birmingham, London, and Manchester). By examining key metrics like impressions, clicks, conversions, and ad spend, we identify trends in campaign performance and audience engagement, providing insights to optimize future marketing efforts.

## Project Goals

1. **Evaluate Campaign Performance**: Identify the campaigns and platforms that generated the highest return on ad spend (ROAS) and conversion rates.
2. **Understand Audience Engagement**: Analyze how different cities, device types, and ad formats influenced clicks, conversions, and impressions.
3. **Extract Actionable Insights**: Offer recommendations for enhancing targeting, maximizing conversions, and improving ad efficiency across channels.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes detailed metrics per campaign, platform, city, device, and ad type:
- **Impressions, Clicks, Conversions**: Core engagement metrics.
- **Likes, Comments, Shares**: Engagement specifics to gauge interaction levels.
- **Spend and Total Conversion Revenue**: Financial metrics to assess ad effectiveness.
- **Calculated Metrics**: ROAS, Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, and Cost per Acquisition (CPA).

## Key Insights

1. **Summer Campaign Success**: 
   - **Highest ROAS**: The Summer campaign yielded the highest ROAS, indicating the best revenue generation per EGP spent.
   - **High Conversion Rate Despite Lower CTR**: Although the Summer campaign had a lower CTR, those who clicked were highly targeted and likely to convert, making it the most effective campaign for conversion.

2. **Platform Analysis**:
   - **Facebook**: Despite high engagement, Facebook exhibited the highest CPA, suggesting potential audience mismatch or optimization needs.
   - **Pinterest**: Pinterest recorded the lowest CPA, indicating it’s the most cost-effective channel for acquiring new customers.
   - **Instagram**: With the highest CTR and profit generation, Instagram’s audience proved highly valuable. While not achieving the top conversion rate, Instagram's profit potential is significant, warranting further segmentation to maximize this audience's value.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

- **Refine Audience Targeting for Facebook**: The high CPA suggests room for improvement in targeting and conversion optimization.
- **Leverage Instagram's Profit Potential**: Implement customer segmentation strategies to better understand high-value Instagram users and enhance targeting.
- **Optimize Ad Spend on Pinterest**: Given Pinterest’s efficiency in CPA, explore opportunities to scale efforts on this platform to maximize cost-effective conversions.
